<p>Before you install or upgrade MyBB, you need to download it to your computer. The latest version of MyBB can always be found on the  <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.mybb.com/downloads">MyBB Official Website</a>. The release can be downloaded in either ZIP or GZIP format for people using different operating systems. The download is just over <b>1 MB</b> and should take no more than 4-5 minutes on a Dial Up connection.
</p><p>Once you have downloaded the file, it's time to unzip it. Using an archive utility capable of decompressing the download format (eg: <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.winzip.com/">Winzip</a>), unzip it to a location where you can access the files shortly (perhaps the desktop?). After that, you can proceed to <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/1.6/Installing/" title="Installing">install</a> or <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/1.6/Upgrading/" title="Upgrading">upgrade</a>.
