## Extend Site Documentation - Downloaders

[Main Page](https://community.mybb.com/mods.php)

As a user you're simply looking to download something: a plugin, a theme, an icon set, perhaps a language pack or just some other resource that you may find interesting.

For that reason, you can quickly navigate from the menu to one of the 4 main categories:

- Plugins

- Themes

- Translations

- Graphics

Each main category has sub-categories, each with filtering options.


### Browsing a category

When you visit a category page, here's how it looks like:

[![Browsing and Filtering](/assets/images/extend/downloaders1.png)](/assets/images/extend/downloaders1.png)

For each project you can view the cover and the following information:

- Title

- Small Description

- Stars

- Downloads

- Last Update

There is also a download button that allows you to download the latest **stable** build.

Clicking the project names or the Details button directs you towards the project page, on which you can see detailed information: full description, previews, license, suggestions, bugs, etc.

On the right side you can select a subcategory.

### Viewing a Project

When you visit a project page, here's how it looks like:

Under this buttons there is a tab with the following links:

#### Bug Tracker

This page is only available to downloaders if the project owner set it like that (by default it's turned off for everyone).

From here you can post bugs that you found, search for others and reply to them.
