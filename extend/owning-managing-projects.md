[![Control Panel 2](/assets/images/mods/owners2.png)](/assets/images/mods/owners2.png)

You can see your projects and the projects you are involved in (as a collaborator) as well as any pending project invitations sent to you.


#### Start a Project

If you wish to start a project, you must click New Project to expand the project options.

All fields are required, so you will need to fill them all. You are also asked to upload a ZIP of your project's files.

The build is considered a 'development' build so you will need to request for it to be changed to 'stable' at a later point.

#### Manage Projects

On this page you can see a list of all projects you are in involed in and the projects you own.

### Viewing a Project

As the owner of a project, this is what a project of yours will look like when you view its page:

On the right side of the page you can find the links to the pages where you can manage your project's details, collaborators, previews, translations and more importantly, builds.

#### Edit Project

This is where you can edit all your project's details (actually you can edit more here than you can enter when creating the project).

As you can see, there are many options for you configure.
